Phone Idol is an experiment in using the http://twilio.com API for something fun.  You can see it in action at http://phone-idol.com

There are two basic pieces:

phoneidol-plugin is a WordPress plugin that talks to Twilio via TwiML, and posts phoned-in content to the DB as WordPress posts.

phoneidol-theme is an adaptation of the Stripey theme http://wordpressthemesbase.com/detail/986.html that is tailored for this purpose.

Not included are several other plugins that are in use at http://phone-idol.com:

 * GD Star Rating: http://www.gdstarrating.com/
 * Audio Player: http://wpaudioplayer.com/
 * Sociable: http://blogplay.com/plugin
 
Enjoy!
